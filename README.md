Emacs minor mode to avoid RSI.

It forces you to type slowly by inhibiting typing for a customizable amount of
time and issuing a warning when you type too quickly.

Chris Done created [the original
package](https://github.com/chrisdone/chrisdone-emacs/blob/master/packages/slow-keys/slow-keys.el). Manuel UbertiÂ merely
extracted it from its configuration and polished it for MELPA.

## Configuration without `use-package`
